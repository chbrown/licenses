# `licenses`

A collection of licenses I use in my work.


### Parity

Most of my open source projects are published on GitHub, so by publishing the license on GitHub, too, I've established parity between projects and license.
If GitHub disappears, then these licenses will disappear, but so will my projects to which these licenses apply.

As of 2016-06-08, [GitHub pages officially supports SSL/TLS](https://github.com/blog/2186-https-for-github-pages), so these URLs all specify the secure `https://` protocol, though the `http://` alternatives still work.
